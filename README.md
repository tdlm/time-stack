# Time Stack

A _very_ simple vertical event listing and filtering app.

## Requirements

You must have at least `Node v10` to run this locally. You can check your Node version in Terminal like so:

```bash
node -v
```

## Installation

First, clone the repo somewhere on your Mac/Linux system:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tdlm/time-stack.git ~/Sites/time-stack
```

Then, cd into the repo directory and run `npm install`:

```bash
cd ~/Sites/time-stack
npm install
```

## Running Locally

Once you have the app installed, you can run it locally like so:

`npm start`

This will start WebPack Dev Server and it _should_ open up a web browser pointing to http://localhost:8080/ on your system.
